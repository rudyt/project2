Have to use javascript for the fb logout. There may be many clients open and we want to do the fb logout
 and delete the cookie in only the client we want to logout from, not every client that is logged on.








































aim small miss small------Review code everyday morning, else lose track and take 1 week to get back to which
problem I was solving. Like I lost track that I need to implement logout from facebook function.

Implement Logout from Facebook button feature. -----

From facebook, get handle from access token and put info in database. like name age. 
Add to UserData table in facebook_user.aspx.cs

Remove userid from table. Have an extra column for facebookID and default it to NULL. If not NULL, 
it is facebook user.

After first login, check if facebook ID already in table. If not, he is logging in first time.--msg = welcome back
